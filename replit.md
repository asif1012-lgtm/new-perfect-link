# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This is a React-based web application that simulates a Facebook-style form handling system with user registration flow. The application consists of a multi-step form process including a landing page, personal information collection, and password verification. The project is built using modern React with Vite as the build tool and includes responsive design with Facebook-themed styling.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1 with functional components and hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.14 for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: CSS with Tailwind utility classes and custom CSS variables
- **State Management**: Local React state using useState hooks
- **Component Structure**: Modular component architecture with separation of concerns

### Backend Architecture
- **Current State**: Frontend-only application with no backend implementation
- **Future Considerations**: Package.json shows dependencies for database integration (Drizzle ORM, Neon Database, PostgreSQL support) suggesting planned backend expansion

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Current**: Local state management only
- **Planned**: Database integration capabilities are present but not implemented
  - Drizzle ORM for database operations
  - PostgreSQL support via Neon Database serverless
  - Form data persistence capabilities

## Key Components

### Page Components
1. **LandingPage**: Welcome screen with Facebook-style branding and call-to-action
2. **Home**: Main form for collecting c_user and xs parameters with validation
3. **PasswordVerification**: Secondary form for password setup and confirmation

### Utility Components
1. **FormInput**: Reusable form input component with validation support
2. **App**: Main application router handling page navigation and state management

### Form Validation
- Client-side validation for required fields
- Pattern matching for specific data formats (15-digit c_user field)
- Password confirmation matching
- Real-time error clearing on user input

## Data Flow

1. **Landing Page**: User interaction triggers navigation to main form
2. **Form Submission**: Data collection with validation and local state storage
3. **Password Setup**: Secondary form linked to initial submission data
4. **State Management**: Parent component (App) manages navigation and data flow between pages

## External Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
- **React**: Core framework for UI components
- **React DOM**: DOM rendering for React components

### Development Dependencies
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: React integration for Vite

### Unused Dependencies (Present but not implemented)
- **UI Components**: Extensive Radix UI component library
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, Neon Database serverless
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with resolvers
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Utilities**: Various utility libraries (class-variance-authority, clsx, date-fns)

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Server**: Vite development server on port 5000
- **Host Configuration**: Supports multiple host patterns for Replit deployment
- **HMR**: Hot module replacement disabled, using polling for file watching

### Production Build
- **Build Command**: `vite build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/`
- **Preview**: `vite preview` for production build testing

### Replit Configuration
- **Modules**: Node.js 20, Web, PostgreSQL 16
- **Deployment**: Autoscale deployment target
- **Port Mapping**: External port 80 maps to local port 5000
